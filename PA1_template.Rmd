```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(ggplot2)
opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE,fig.width=12, fig.height=8)
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
activity <- read.csv('./activity/activity.csv')
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
# Calculate total number of steps per day
total_steps <- tapply(activity$steps,activity$date,sum)
# Plot the histrogram
qplot(total_steps, geom="histogram")
# Calculate and report the mean and median 
mean.steps <- mean(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median.steps <- median(total_steps, na.rm = TRUE)
```
The mean of total number of steps taken per day is `r mean.steps`. The meadian of total number of steps taken per day is `r median.steps`

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
